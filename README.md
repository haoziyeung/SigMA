### 2. Description

SigMA is a signature analysis tool optimized to detect the mutational signature associated to HR defect, Signature 3, from hybrid capture panels, exomes and whole genome sequencing. For panels with low SNV counts, conventional signature analysis tools do not perform well while the novel approach of SigMA allows it to detect Signature 3-positive tumors with 74% sensitivity at 10% false positive rate. One novelty of SigMA is a likelihood based matching: We associate a new patient's mutational spectrum to subtypes of tumors according to their signature composition. The subtypes of tumors are defined using the WGS data from ICGC and TCGA consortia, by a clustering of signature fractions with hierarchical clustering. The likelihood of the sample to belong to each tumor subtype is calculated, and the likelihood of Signature 3 is the sum of the likelihoods of all Signature 3-positive tumor subtypes. The second novel step is the multivariate analysis with gradient boosting machines, which allows us to obtain a final score for presence of Signature-3 combining likelihood with cosine similarity and exposure of Signature 3 obtained with non-negativel-least-squares (NNLS) algorithm. The multivariate analysis allows us to automatically handle different sequencing platforms. For different platforms different methods for signature analysis become more efficient, e.g. for WGS data it is not necessary to associate the tumor to a subtype of tumors, because it is possible to determine Signature 3 with NNLS acurately. We have a new feature also for these cases and we calculate the likelihood of NNLS decomposition to be unique. This likelihood value was found to be the most influential feature in the multivariate analysis.

### 4. Functionalities:

* Optional input format for mutation data vcf, maf, or directly a 96-dimensional matrix
* If vcf or maf files are provided it constructs the 96-dimensional SNV matrix with trinucleotide context
* Contains a database of signature clusters, defining tumor subtypes, for multiple tumor type
* For each input sample calculates:
   * Likelihood values of the tumor subtypes
   * Cosine similarity for all signatures
   * Exposures of signatures which are found in the matching tumor type
* Output
  * Tumor type specific final decision for existence of Signature 3
  * Plot of the mutational spectra and other relevant variables obtained from this such as likelihoods, cosine similarity and exposures, as well as the information on the signatures of the matched tumor subtype

### 5. Quick start 
`git clone https://github.com/parklab/SigMA`

`cd SigMA`

`Rscript install.R`

`Rscript test.R`

or 

`Rscript test_maf.R`

More details on the optional settings can be found in the User's Manual

### 6. Input/Output file format

#### Input 

**MAF file example:** For MAF file format, both a single file with multiple samples, or a directory which contains multiple files with a single sample in each, is accepted.
You can download the [test_mutations_50sample.maf](test_mutations_50sample.maf) file on this repository and use this for testing. 

**VCF file example:** Direct SigMA to a directory with multiple VCF files. Two test samples can be found in:
`cd inst/extdata/`

#### Output

There are two different outputs formats a large format or a lite format where the information in the large format is summarized using `lite_df()` function. The conversion can be done after the output is produced using the output file of the `run()` function, let's say is called output_file_name:

```
df <- read.csv(output_file_name)
lite <- lite_df(df)
```
or by setting `lite_format = T` in the settings of `run()`.

In the lite file:
* `total_snvs` indicates the number of SNVs in that sample
* columns ending with `_ml` indicate the total likelihood of clusters which are high in that signature, e.g. `Signature_3_ml` is the total likelihood of clusters with Signature 3
* `Signature_3_c` is the cosine similarity to Signature 3
* `exp_sig3` is the exposure of Signature 3 calculated with NNLS
* `Signature_3_l_rat` is the likelihood ratio of the NNLS decomposition with Signature 3 considering the possibility of an alternative decompositions without Signature 3. A value of 0.5 indicate that an NNLS decomposition without Signature 3 is as likely.
* `Signature_3_mva` is the SigMA score indicating the presence of Signature 3 estimated by the gradient boosting classifier implemented in SigMA
* `pass_mva` and `pass_mva_strict` are booleans indicating the presence of Signature 3 with the looser and strict selection thresholds that corresponds to 10% FPR and 1-5% FPR respectively
* `sigs_all` and `exps_all` are the names of signatures included in NNLS calculation and the exposures.
* `categ` is the general category the sample falls into according to the dominant signatures. The `Signature_3_hc` indicates that the sample passes the strict threshold and hc stands for high confidence, and `Signature_3_lc` indicates that the sample passes the looser threshold but not the strict threshold.

### 7. Tumor type and data tags

Using `list_tumor_types()` function you can see the options for `tumor_type` parameter for the `run()` function, similarly use `list_data_options()` to see the available `data` parameters. You can see if the SNV counts in your data aggrees with the mutation counts in the datasets for tuning the gradient boosting classifiers by running info(data, tumor_type). If the values disagree the cutoffs on the score listed in `Signature_3_mva` column of SigMA output needs to be optimized or a new model needs to be tuned. 
 
Tags and descriptions of performance of SigMA for signature 3 detection. The exploratory tumor types should be used with `do_mva = F` and `do_assign = F` settings for the `run()` function for these tumor types if you want to investigate presence of Signature_3 set `add_sig3 = T` which will then allow assignment of Signature 3 to the tumors even if this signature was not discovered by NMF in the WGS data for these tumor types.
